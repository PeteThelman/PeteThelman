✧ - Hey ! I'm Pete, also known as Eddie or sometimes Sam.

✧ - I am 15 years old and my birthday is on July 4th, I think older than I am but I act younger, if my age bothers you, I'm sorry

✧ - I am autistic, I have adhd, and I have echolalia. I am a slow learner and forget a lot of things easily, I also tend to get very nervous when meeting new people.

✧ - For those who are unfamiliar with what echolalia is, it's basically where I repeat things that I either hear verbally or internally! So if I copy your words, I apologize

✧ - I am a lesbian and I am asexual, I have a girlfriend of 4 years who is also lesbian! Her names are Dakota, Eric, and sometimes Deo, but a lot of people know her as DakoTaco.

✧ - Any negativety towards her while you are speaking to me will not be tolerated considering the fact that she is innocent and was simply fufilling a request of her now ex friend, who was also my ex partner (And if you're reading this Eric, sorry for repeatedly sharing this, I just don't want anyone trash talking you)

✧ - I use any pronouns along with it/its and a couple neos, and if you have a problem with neos, then dni. For those who are interested in what neos I use, I use Meow/Meowself and Vamp/Vampself! and if you wanna call me Meowbahh, then dni
